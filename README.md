This is the first workshop in the series and will be focused on the fundamentals that underpin cloud computing and [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-cloud-computing/), the world's computer. Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the Cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping you lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as a business changes.
