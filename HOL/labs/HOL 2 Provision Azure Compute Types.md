# Hands-on-Lab 2: Provision Azure Compute Types

**Duration**: 10-15 minutes
## Learning Objectives
Let's start off with the basics and a complete a familiar exercise - provisioning a resource, namely a Wordpress application that will be entirely hosted in Azure. Although we also provision a SQL Database and an Azure App Service, we won't be going into any of the details of this for HOL 1, but **rather walking through the motions of creating resources using Azure Portal**.

## Our Goal 

Our goal is to provision a Wordpress Installation Azure Website that our users can use to install WordPress on their local device. We're going to achieve this by:

- Creating an Azure Subscription
- Provisioning an Azure Resource Group
- Provisioning a Wordpress website through an Azure Web App
    - Provision an Azure Web App Service plan
    - Provision a Azure SQL Database
